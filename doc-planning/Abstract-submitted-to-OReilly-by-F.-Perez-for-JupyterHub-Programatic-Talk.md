Title: JupyterHub: A roadmap of recent developments and future directions
Speakers: Min Ragan-Kelley, Carol Willing
Abstract:

JupyterHub is a multiuser server for Jupyter notebooks. Min Ragan-Kelley and Carol Willing discuss exciting recent additions and future plans for the project, including sharing notebooks with students and collaborators. With Release 0.7, JupyterHub has added the concept of services, which adds the ability to deploy new applications with JupyterHub. Services provide a foundation for adding functionality and customizing your deployment to your specific needs. Looking to the future, JupyterHub’s internal authentication implementation is moving to OAuth. Using OAuth as the default for internal authentication makes it easier to integrate and offer services that already support OAuth. As researchers, educators, and industry professionals, you frequently collaborate with peers and publish data for others to use. Min and Carol share JupyterHub’s use to develop sharing tools for publishing and collaborating on notebooks and to enhance the distribution and collection of notebooks as educational or work assignments using tools like nbgrader.
